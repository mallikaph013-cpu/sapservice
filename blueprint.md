# Blueprint: SAP Service Web App

## Overview

This document outlines the blueprint for a .NET-based web application designed to streamline SAP service requests. The application will provide a user-friendly interface for creating, tracking, and managing service requests, with a focus on clear separation of concerns and a robust, scalable architecture.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

*   **Framework:** Bootstrap 5 for a responsive, mobile-first layout.
*   **Font:** "Poppins" from Google Fonts for a clean, modern aesthetic.
*   **Icons:** Font Awesome for intuitive user interface elements.
*   **Color Palette:** A professional and visually balanced color scheme will be implemented.

### Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration.
*   **Request Management:** Create, view, edit, and delete service requests.
*   **Master Data Management:** A dedicated section for managing master data related to requests.
*   **User Management:** An administrative interface for managing user accounts.

## Current Plan

The current objective is to prepare the project for its initial push to a GitHub repository. This involves the following steps:

1.  **Stage all project files:** Use `git add .` to include all new and modified files in the staging area.
2.  **Commit the staged files:** Create a commit with a descriptive message that reflects the initial state of the project.
3.  **Push to GitHub:** Push the commit to the remote repository.
