# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application built with .NET and is designed to be developed within the Firebase Studio (formerly Project IDX) environment. The focus is on creating a robust and scalable application by leveraging ASP.NET Core's powerful features for routing, data handling, and backend logic, with a focus on a "Fat Model, Skinny Controller" approach.

##- Current Styles and Features

- **Color Palette:** The application now uses a modern and energetic color palette featuring a prominent orange as the primary color, complemented by a clean white background. This creates a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Typography:** The default font is 'Helvetica Neue', with fallback to Helvetica, Arial, and sans-serif for wide compatibility.
- **Buttons:** Primary buttons have a distinct orange background, making them stand out and clearly indicating primary actions.
- **Links:** Hyperlinks are styled with the same vibrant orange color to maintain consistency throughout the application.
- **Error Handling:** The application includes a styled error boundary to provide clear feedback to the user in case of an error.

##- Current Change: Theming

- **Objective:** To change the application's color scheme to an orange and white theme.
